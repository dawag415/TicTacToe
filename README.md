# TicTacToe

##Tic-Tac-Toe Game built in react native
    The one assumption I made in building this is that both players are human and have the ability to touch the screen.  I did not design this with an AI.



## installation
Open TicTacToe folder.

## `npm install`

## run

#### `react-native run-ios`

Attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `react-native run-android`

Attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
